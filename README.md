# StuttgartGems
<table>
<tr>
<td>
    This is my first real web application. I had no idea what to built, then I just figured as I 
    relocating to Stuttgart it would be nice to know what places are worth visiting. So Stuttgart 
    Gems is basically my personal tripadviser for one particular city. It is not fancy from frontend 
    point of view. Main push was on the backend part. This site was built partially using MEAN 
    stack. Partially, because it is not SPA, so no Angular. The rest is here.

## Demo
Here is a working live demo : https://stuttgartgems.herokuapp.com/

## Mobile support
The WebApp is using Bootstrap, so it is responsive.

### Development
This project is just my little playground for learning nodejs. By that I mean there could be
bugs here and there, if you catch one, feel free to contribute. Of course, if you want to.

To fix a bug or enhance the app, follow these steps:

- Fork the repo
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b improve-gems`)
- Make the appropriate changes in the files
- Add changes to reflect the changes made
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Improve feature'`)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin improve-gems`)
- Create a Pull Request
